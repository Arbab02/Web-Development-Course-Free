    <!-- HTML semantic elements are tags that provide meaning to the content they
    enclose, describing both their purpose and the structure of the web page.
    Using semantic elements makes the HTML more readable and understandable,
    both for developers and browsers, and improves accessibility and SEO. Here
    are some key semantic elements: -->

    <!-- <header>: Represents the introductory content or a set of navigational links for a section or page. -->

    <!-- <nav>: Defines a set of navigation links. -->

    <!-- <section>: Defines a section in a document, such as a chapter, part of a page, or any other section of content. -->
   
    <!-- <footer>: Defines the footer for a section or page, often containing information about the author, copyright, or navigation links. -->
  
    <!-- <time>: Represents a specific time (24-hour clock), or a precise date in the Gregorian calendar. -->
